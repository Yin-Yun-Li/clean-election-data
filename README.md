# Processed Election data in Taiwan

## Motivation
The Central Election Commission provides a rich electoral dataset in Taiwan.
However, the raw data has not been systematically cleaned, requiring researchers to spend substantial time understanding its structure.

This repository offers detailed code files and a set of basic cleaned datasets.
Researchers can combine these datasets with other variables of interest to conduct more advanced analyses.

I hope this resource helps reduce the time required to clean this messy dataset.

## Code
Some parts of the code may be inefficient. If you have better strategies for cleaning the raw data, please feel free to share your ideas with me. I also plan to provide a clearer explanation of the code logic in the future.

## Dataset
Nationwide and county-level election data has been cleaned.
The datasets are organized at the village level and cover the period from 2008 to 2024. A codebook is currently in progress (QQ). 


If you find any mistakes in the dataset or the cleaning process, please feel free to contact me.
